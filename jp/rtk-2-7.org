#+DESCRIPTION: First week review

This was a first week my of Kanji studying rush. The task itself seems
doable, although I must admit, it is a difficult trial for my
discipline and self-organization skills.

A bit of statistics gathered so far:

  - days studied: 5/7
  - kanji learned: 172
  - average reviews per day: 45 review + 34 new
  - average daily study time: 2 hours

Looking back it is clear now that studying every day is a good
practice, because despite an acceptable cadence of ~30 kanji per day,
and a half-day brainstorm on Sunday (68 new kanji), I'm behind of my
weekly target of ~200 new kanji.

Anyway, the journey is just began, and I would have plenty of
opportunities to close the gap later on.
