<h1>Remembering the Kanji in 60 days: day 1</h1>
<p>
Couple of months ago I decided to learn Japanese language just for fun
and brain exercise. Seriously, why not?
</p>

<p>
Without much effort I get through basic character sets (Hiragana and
Katakana) and a very basic vocabulary. I thought it is time to dig
into native Japanese texts and boost vocabulary by immersing myself
into music, web sites, newspapers, etc. Result was expected - a
complete failure. I couldn't read anything without all mighty Google
Translator, I even couldn't navigate websites in Japanese while trying
to find simpler texts.
</p>

<p>
Kanji characters were the obvious problem: I couldn't read them,
didn't know a translation, and I couldn't skip them and try to catch a
general idea of a text: most of words are written in kanji.
</p>

<p>
This lead me to only one decision: I need to learn them all in a
shortest period of time possible.
</p>

<p>
Why shortest? If I spend a year on this study I would most likely give
up or just forget what I was learning a half-year ago.
</p>

<p>
Target is set:
</p>
<ul class="org-ul">
<li>2000 kanji characters with basic translation</li>
<li>learn all in 60 days</li>
<li>daily repetition with Anki</li>
<li>post updates on this blog</li>
</ul>

<p>
About the last bullet: today is 17 July 2017. If you are reading this
half-year after and there is no "Day 60" update on this blog - that
means I failed to achieve my goal, shame on me.
</p>

<p>
I would be using "Remembering the Kanji" book authored by James
W. Heisig (later called RTK). This book is well-known for great
associations for each kanji (so called 'stories'). Another great thing
about RTK is that kanji characters are ordered by their 'form', and
not a frequency. That means similarly looking kanji characters would
be close to each other.
</p>

<p>
I, personally, never liked 'stories' to remember foreign words, but
order by form is ideal for a 'rush' study: it should teach to
distinguish between similar kanji.
</p>

<p>
Sounds pretty challenging.
Ready, set, go!

<h2 id="org1c33be9">Day 1</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-org1c33be9">
<p>
That was simple: 2 lessons from RTK, total 34 kanji. With some
handwriting practice I easily get through all of them in Anki.
</p>

<p>
I'm sure the next few days would be a lot more intense.
